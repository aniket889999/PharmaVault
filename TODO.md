# TODO: Add 3D Visualization to Dashboard

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Create Dashboard3D.tsx component with 3D scene including interactive bars for stats, 3D medicine models, and clickable buttons
- [x] Update OverviewDashboard.tsx to integrate the 3D component in the stats section
- [x] Test the 3D integration by running the dev server and verifying interactivity

## Notes
- Use @react-three/fiber and @react-three/drei for 3D rendering
- Ensure 3D elements are interactive (hover, click)
- Focus on making dashboard elements "touchable" in 3D
